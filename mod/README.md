# IT266-Q2-Mod
Quake 2 Mod for IT266 by Myles Alcala

__UNCATCHABLE__

The basic idea of this mod is that the more you kill enemies, the faster your movement speed and firing rate become. 

I could not figure out movement speed but firing rate increases & damage increase instead. Because firing rate is linked to frames, there is a limit to how fast you can fire. I implemented the "Uncatchable system" that tracks kills. As you continue to slay enemies, your Uncatchable status will increase from x1 to x5. 


Graded Deliverables:

__Unlockable abilities:__

Wings of a New Age (Flying) - Available at Uncatchable x5, (CTRL)

Stoneman's Undying Endurance (High Damage Threshold) - Available at Uncatchable x4, (ALT)

__Weapons:__
Blaster, Shotgun - Firing rates increase significantly depending on status. Damage increases indefinitely!

*Due to frame issues, sometimes mod bugs out around x5 firing rate. Just restart if this happens.*

__UI shows perks:__
